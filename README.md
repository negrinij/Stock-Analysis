# Stock-Analysis
Time series modelling for the prediction of stocks prices is a challenging task. Political events, market expectations and economic factors are just a few known factors that can impact financial market behaviour. The financial market is a complex, noisy, evolutionary and chaotic field of study that attracts many enthusiasts and researches â€” the first, usually driven by the economic benefit of it, the latter, inspired by the challenge of handling such complex data.

This project aims to predict Facebook (FB) next day stock price direction with machine learning algorithms. Technical indicators and global market indexes are used, and their influence on the forecast accuracy is analysed. The machine learning models applied to stock movement forecasting are SVM, random forest and logistic regression. An analysis of using an Ensemble Model is also performed. Final results are compared with existing literature for Facebook stock.
